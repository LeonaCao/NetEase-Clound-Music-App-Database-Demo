# NetEase-Clound-Music-App-Database-Simplified-Demo

This is a group project I completed with another two classmates Simeng Deng and Zhuo Chen during my Data Management and Business Process Modeling course. In this project we created a relational database with multiple entities to try to demonstrate the operating model of NetEase Cloud Music, a well-known music application in China.
